# Songs to Print

Ryan Gosling's band want to beautifully print their own songs titles. They want to check the title length, and if it is more than 15 symbols, add to this title the prefix "Our long song: " and make it uppercase; otherwise, add "Our short song: " and make it lowercase. Using the scope function with, realize this idea for these cool guys and output the result.

## Sample Input 1:

```
Pa Pa Power
```

## Sample Output 1:

```
our short song: pa pa power
```
