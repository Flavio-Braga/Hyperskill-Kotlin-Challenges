# Map of Buttons

You have a `map` with the names of 
buttons and corresponding font sizes and also a data class with default 
parameters. Write the body of the `apply` function so that 
your code could receive the name of a button from standard 
input, assign this value to the parameter `text`, and assign 
the corresponding value from `map` to the parameter 
`textSize`. After that, your code should print the new 
parameters to standard output like in the example. It's 
guaranteed that the input string will be contained in the map 
as `key`.

### Sample Input 1:

```
Button
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
New settings: TextField(text=Button, textSize=14, fontFamily=Roboto)
```
